Feature Matching in Image Processing: SIFT, SURF, ORB, and AKAZE This repository explores and benchmarks key feature detection and matching techniques in image processing, focusing on SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform), SURF (Speeded-Up Robust Features), ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF), and AKAZE (Accelerated-KAZE).
